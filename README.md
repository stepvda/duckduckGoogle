# DuckDuckGoogle #

Adds a button on the DuckDuckGo.com search results page to repeat the same search in Google.

>**_Use case:_** We all appreciate our privacy on the web but sometimes letting the big brothers of this world know a little something about us can help them deliver us a better service. I've switched to !duckduckgo.com for a while now. First it was the adds on Google search that annoyed me and then we all became aware of what Google does with all our data. Still sometimes I find myself searching the web and not getting what I need. Sometimes simply repeating the same search query on Google actually does give you better results. I do say sometims, because for me at leat usually it's the other way around. In any case when you don't find what you need on `duck`give `google`a try with single click of a button and you might get lucky. 

Consists of manual version and userscript (duckduckGoogle.user.js with commitID: 6a4c1524eda4d5c35ee20d23197283c4ad7fcd47) version that must be installed with GreaseMonkey

Still to do:

- [ ] add google branding to the new search button
- [ ] add search buttons to other resluts pages (images, videos, ...)
- [ ] add into chrome extension for easy deployment so you don't need userscripts.
